This workshop is an introduction to using high-performance computing systems
effectively. We can't cover every case or give an exhaustive course on parallel
programming in just an hour of teaching time. Instead, this workshop is intended
to give students an introduction and overview of the tools available and
how to use them effectively.

> ## Prerequisites
>
>  * Command line experience is necessary for this lesson. We recommend the  participants to go through [shell-novice](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), if new to the command line (also known as terminal or shell).
>  * Attended an On-boarding/introductory session for the Mana HPC
> 
{: .prereq}

By the end of this workshop, students will know how to:

* Identify problems a cluster can help solve
* Use the UNIX shell (also known as terminal or command line) to operate a
  computer, connect to a cluster, and write simple shell scripts.
* Submit and manage jobs on a cluster using a scheduler, transfer files, and
  use software through environment modules.

> ## Getting Started
>
> To get started, follow the directions in the "[Setup](
